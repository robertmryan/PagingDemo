This demonstrates two different approaches for scrolling through a series of child view controllers, and seeing the various appearance related methods called for the various child view controller:

* Use scroll view, do your own containment calls and detect intersection of the current content visible in the scroll view to know which children to add and remove; or
* Use page view controller, which does all of this for you.

Developed in Xcode 11.7 (11E801a). But it should work on any recent versions of Xcode.
